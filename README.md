# rekindl
ReKindl is a social media web-app to provide reminders and conversation topics for friends and family afraid of losing touch.
The backend uses spaCy (NLP Python library) to measure similarity between words/phrases that describe the interests of users and their friends.
Then, logistic regression and examples of similar/dissimilar interests were used to approximate a similarity level which constituted a "shared interest" or a conversation starter for each of your connections.
